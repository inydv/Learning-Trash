        <h3>COLOR OF THE MONTH- 30 DAYS, 1 SHADE!</h3>
        <p>
          When was the last time you played the colour game that we all loved in
          our childhood? Well, we believe that we are always children at heart
          and for all the children within us, TheLittleThing.com runs colour of
          the month. Color of the month is a vibe that we feel every month. To
          communicate that to our consumers and creating the mood for it is our
          sole purpose. Our palette refreshes every month and every color has a
          story to tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          A fresh new concept for online fashion, for fresh new looks. Every
          month on the first, we choose a new colour and showcase all our
          products for that particular colour. Apparels, mostly solid colored
          plain t-shirts, are available at an exclusive discounted price every
          first of the month. There are options available in sleeve styles
          Boyfriend sleeves for women, full sleeve t-shirts for men and more.
          You can buy those throughout the month but the exclusive price will
          only be valid for that one day, the first of every month. Online
          shopping never seemed so fresh and exciting. So hurry up and stack
          your cart with your favourite colour before it goes out of stock!

        <h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in creating the kind of fashion, that makes you stand out
          as they are in line with the latest local and global trends of the
          industry, but also at the same time offer value for money
          functionality, with quality materials and comfortable and flattering
          prints. We try to look into the psyche of our customers, and try to
          get inspired by the conversations and experiences around us while
          creating our graphics, to ensure that they are relatable. We believe
          in constant and consistent innovation to ensure that our fans get
          nothing short of the bets at affordable rates! While most people do
          not know, we do not outsource the manufacturing of our products,
          everything from the conception of the designs to the manufacture and
          the styling that you see on the photographs of the banners and product
          pages of our website all happen in house! We go from yarn to product
          and since we 're vertically integrated and bring fashion from us
          directly to your doorstep without any middlemen that also further
          ensures reliability because for us it is not just about the money but
          about building the trust and credibility in our fans about our brand.
          We also make sure to decrease the impact on environment and are
          building initiatives that will help us with the same, for now by
          optimizing our processes to use only as much as we need from nature,
          rain water harvesting and recycling the water from our RO water
          facility, because we believe that the spirit of TheLittleThing is
          about creating an impact by breaking conventions and having a
          different perspective!
